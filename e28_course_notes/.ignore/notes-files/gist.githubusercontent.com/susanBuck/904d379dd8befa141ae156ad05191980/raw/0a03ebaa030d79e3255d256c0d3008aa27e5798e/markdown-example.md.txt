Here is some text that demonstrates basic Markdown syntax.

To italicize text, we surround it with one asterisk, *like so*.
To make text bold, we surround it with two asterisks, **like so**.

To create an unordered list, we prefix each list item with an asterisk:
* Thing 1
* Thing 2
* Thing 3

To create links, we put the link label in square brackets, followed by the link address in parenthesis. For example, here's a link to the [Wikipedia page about Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

To write a block of code, we start with three backticks, followed by the file extension for the language we're using. For example, here's a block of JavaScript code:

```js
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
console.log(x + y);
```

We can also include smaller snippets of code inline with other text using single backticks. For example I might say that the line `let x = 1;` above sets the variable `x` to the value `1`.

Finally, using the hash symbol we can create headings:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
