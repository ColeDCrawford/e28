# Project 2: Mountain Project Browser

## Project sketch
I've been thinking about building a comprehensive activity tracking and mountain training website. Strava works well for logging runs and bike rides; Mountain Project works well for ticking climbs; Garmin works well for logging cardio and GPS. But none of them work particularly well together. It would be great to pull together multiple different activity streams into one location. This project is far too big for this class, but I'm planning on building something that uses both Mountain Project's API (to retrieve routes and "ticks" or completions of those routes) and my own scrape of MP's entire route database to build some features I wish they had. These include better data visualization of ticks, more structured data about climbs (eg type of climb - slab vs hand crack vs offwidth; pitch by pitch difficulty breakdown, etc), the ability to "follow" other users and more.

## Pages summary
-   My Climbs
-   Follow a user
-   Users I follow (stream of ticks)

## SFC summary
